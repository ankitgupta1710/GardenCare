              <p>Gardeners often disregard the impact soil has on the health and vigor of their plants. Soil preparation
                isn’t the most thrilling aspect of planting a garden, but it’s certainly one of the most important. If
                your
                soil isn’t right, your garden will struggle to reach its full potential.<br> <br> “A garden is a
                reflection
                of the quality of its soil. Gardens filled with beautiful soil have a vitality about them that we can
                almost
                feel,” says landscape designer and author Jan Johnsen.

                <br><br>Achieving that vitality requires understanding the chemistry and composition of your soil and
                creating the perfect environment for fertile plant growth. Good soil management is a continual process,
                but
                once you attend to the basics, your soil will do most of the work itself.

          <h2>Know Your Soil Type</h2>
          <p>Before you begin planting, dig up a scoop of soil and take a look at its texture. Is it dense and heavy and
            clump together when wet? Or is it loose and free flowing, like play sand? Maybe it’s somewhere in between,
            feeling somewhat sticky but crumbling easily, like a freshly baked cookie.<br> <br>All soils are a mixture
            of mineral particles — primarily clay, sand, and silt. Often they will contain higher amounts of one type of
            particle relative to the others. That doesn’t make them bad growing mediums, but it will affect their
            density, drainage rate, and capacity to hold nutrients.<br> <br>With each soil type, there are trade-offs.
            Here’s a quick overview:</p>
          <ul class="bull">
            <li><strong>Clay soils</strong> have tiny, dense particles that hold large reserves of moisture and
              nutrients. However, clay soil also drains slowly and can become hard and compacted when dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Sandy soils</strong> are just the opposite, with large particles that water moves through easily
              — along with important nutrients.</li>
            <li><strong>Silts</strong> have fine particle sizes that pack together tightly, inhibiting drainage and air
              circulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Loam </strong>is the ideal soil for most plants; it contains a balance of all three mineral
              particles and is rich in humus (what’s left after organic matter decomposes).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Adding organic matter is the best way to make your soil more loam-like and improve its structure. Another
            option is to build a raised garden bed and fill it with a well-balanced soil mix. Or take the simple
            approach by growing plants that do well in your soil type, such as choosing drought-tolerant plants for
            sandy soils. You can grow a garden successfully in any soil, as long as the plant’s roots are accustomed to
            the conditions.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Test the pH of Your Soil</h3>
          <br>
          <p>The pH of your soil is one of the most important factors in determining its fertility. If your soil is too
            alkaline (with a pH above 7.5) or to acidic (with a pH below 5.5), that can make a big difference in which
            nutrients are available to your plants.

          </p>
          <p>Although most plants will tolerate a wide range of pH levels, they prefer slightly acidic soils (with a pH
            of 6 to 7) because important nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium
            dissolve readily in that environment. In soils that are too acidic or alkaline, your plants may get too much
            of some nutrients and not enough of others.</p>
          <br>
          <blockquote>How do you test your soil pH? Here are two options:<br><br>
            <ul class="bull">
              <li><strong>DIY Soil Test Kit: </strong>For the quickest results, you can buy an instant-read soil test
                kit or electronic tester (such as this one from Amazon).</li>
              <li><strong> Professional Soil Analysis: </strong>But if you’re starting a new garden, it’s a good idea to
                have your soil tested professionally. The soil samples will be sent to a lab, which will analyze your
                soil pH and nutrient content as well as its capacity to retain nutrients. Try the Soil Savvy Test Kit,
                also available on Amazon.</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Be sure to take soil samples from different sites in your garden because the pH can vary quite a bit, even
            within a small backyard. If your pH reading is low (acidic), you can correct it by adding lime to your soil.
            If it’s too high, add powdered sulfur or aluminum sulfate. Another option is to choose plants that will
            thrive at the natural pH level of your soil, such as acid-loving rhododendrons or azaleas.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Enlist the Help of Microorganisms</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Don’t simply think of soil as dirt. Think of it as microscopic world teeming with a vast array of organisms
            that breathe life into your garden. These organisms in your soil ecosystem — including earthworms, insects,
            fungi, and a multitude of beneficial bacteria — act as Mother Nature’s recycling crew, converting dead
            leaves and plant debris into readily available nutrients. They also help to aerate the soil and convert
            organic matter into humus.</p>
          <br>
          <p>“To enlist the help of microorganisms, create favorable conditions. As these are the same conditions that
            promote optimum plant growth, you’ll be doing your garden a double favor,” says Stell. To encourage soil
            life, she recommends keeping your soil evenly moist and well aerated and minimizing the use of pesticides.
            “Many of these are toxic to soil life as well as to whatever insects you’re trying to control,” she says.
            Also avoid the use of concentrated fast-acting fertilizers, which can harm earthworms and other soil
            organisms. Instead, use less-concentrated organic fertilizers and slow-release formulas.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Favor a No-Till Approach</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Gardeners have widely varying opinions about the benefits of tilling. Many are convinced that turning over
            and breaking up the soil every year creates a favorable environment for their plants because it helps to mix
            in organic matter and improve drainage. Others say that tilling is a waste of time and may actually do more
            harm than good — and often they are right.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Tilling has a number of drawbacks. It can encourage the growth of weeds by bringing dormant seeds to the
            surface and exposing them to sunlight. It can disturb the beneficial burrowing activities of earthworms —
            the best free labor you can get for loosening and aerating your soil. It can also interfere with the
            activity of important soil microorganisms. Despite these negatives, tilling is still a viable option if you
            need to work organic matter and nutrients into sticky clay soil or a new garden bed that’s heavily
            compacted. After that initial deep tilling, you can often let nature take its course to improve the
            structure of your soil.</p>
